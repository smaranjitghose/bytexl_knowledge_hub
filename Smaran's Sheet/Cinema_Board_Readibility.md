# Cinema Board Readibility

In an Indian town, the cinemaâ€™s neon signboard has some malfunctioning lights. Certain letters do not glow, which makes it impossible to read any movie title that contains those broken letters.  

You are given a string `titles` containing movie names separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces), and a string `brokenLetters` containing all distinct letters of the English alphabet whose neon lights are broken.  

Return the number of movie titles that can still be fully read from the board.  


## Constraints:
- `1 <= titles.length <= 10^4`  
- `0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26`  
- `titles` consists of movie names separated by a single space without leading or trailing spaces.  
- Each title only consists of lowercase English letters.  
- `brokenLetters` consists of distinct lowercase English letters.
